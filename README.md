# Evapotranspiration Level Prediction Model

### Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to forecast the "Evapotranspiration Level (mm)" based on historical weather and geographical data. The model will leverage date and evapotranspiration-related metrics to generate predictions that can assist in agricultural planning and water resource management.

### Dataset
The dataset includes multiple features related to evapotranspiration across various districts and states, including:
- **Date** (Day, Month, Year)
- **Evapotranspiration Level (mm)**
- **Evapotranspiration Volume (one thousand million cubic feet)**
- **Aggregate Evapotranspiration Level and Volume**

### Objective
The primary goal is to predict the daily "Evapotranspiration Level (mm)" using a regression model. This will help in understanding water usage patterns and improving water conservation strategies.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data processing and modeling.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing the machine learning model.
- **Microsoft Azure**: For deploying the model using Azure Machine Learning Studio.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

### Model Setup
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert 'Date' to datetime and extract relevant components.
   - Handle missing values if any.
   - Normalize/standardize numerical data as required.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Analyze correlations and perform feature importance analysis.
   - Select relevant features to be included in the model.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) on the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
   - Adjust parameters or try different algorithms based on performance.

### Deployment on Azure
1. **Create Azure Machine Learning Workspace**:
   - Set up a workspace in Azure Machine Learning Studio.
   - Create compute resources needed for training and deployment.

2. **Model Training and Registration**:
   - Train the model using Azureâ€™s compute resources.
   - Register the trained model within the workspace for deployment.

3. **Deploy the Model as a Web Service**:
   - Create a scoring script that uses the model to predict new data.
   - Deploy the model as a web service on Azure Container Instances (ACI) or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

4. **Consume Model**:
   - Test the deployed model using sample data.
   - Integrate the web service into applications for real-time predictions.

### Conclusion
This project aims to harness machine learning capabilities to predict evapotranspiration levels, providing valuable insights for ecological and resource management applications. By deploying the model in Azure, we ensure scalability and ease of access for potential integrations.
